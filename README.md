# Bookstore Web scraping

This is a Pyhton based web scraping project for machine learning portfolio. This project is associated with https://books.toscrape.com/ website which is specially design for training web scraping.

In this project I have built a mechanism to collect information about every book in the website, scraping through pagination.

Finally, I have made some conclusions about the data I have collected, using graphical representations like charts and graphs.


## Installation

There are two main libraries that I have used for this project.
